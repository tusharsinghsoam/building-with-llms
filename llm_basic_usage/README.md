# About

## LLM Basic Usage

1. This project contains practical examples demonstrating fundamental concepts and techniques for working with Large Language Models using the Gemini API.

2. It covers essential interaction patterns including single-turn and multi-turn conversations, system instructions for controlling model behavior, and conversational memory for maintaining context across multiple exchanges.

3. Advanced features include streaming responses for real-time content generation, multimodal inputs for processing documents, and prompt engineering techniques that demonstrate how to improve response quality through better prompting strategies.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- API keys for LLM providers (e.g., Gemini API)
