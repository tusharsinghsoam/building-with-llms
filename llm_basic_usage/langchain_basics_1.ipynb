We also support digital wallet payments through PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, and Amazon Pay. Additionally, we offer bank transfer options including ACH transfers, wire transfers, and direct debit for customers who prefer traditional banking methods. For larger purchases, we provide financing options through Affirm, Klarna, and our own in-house financing program with flexible payment plans ranging from 6 to 36 months.

If your order has not yet been processed by our warehouse team and is still in 'pending' or 'confirmed' status, you can easily change the shipping address by logging into your account and accessing the order management section. However, once your order enters the 'processing' phase and our warehouse team begins preparing your items for shipment, address changes become much more complicated and may not be possible. If your order has already shipped, unfortunately we cannot redirect the package to a different address, but you can contact the shipping carrier directly to arrange for package interception or redirection services, though additional fees may apply. For the best chance of successful address modification, we strongly recommend contacting our customer support team immediately at support@company.com or calling our toll-free number.\n",

We have several gift wrapping options available: our standard gift wrap features elegant wrapping paper in various colors and patterns with matching ribbon and a bow for an additional $4.99 per item. Our premium gift wrap option includes luxury wrapping paper, silk ribbon, and decorative embellishments for $9.99 per item. For special occasions, we offer themed wrapping for holidays, birthdays, weddings, and baby showers at $7.99 per item. You can also add personalized gift messages up to 250 characters at no additional cost, and we'll include them on beautiful greeting cards. For an extra $2.99, you can upload custom messages or even photos to be printed on special cards. All gift-wrapped items are carefully packaged to ensure they arrive in perfect condition, and we offer discrete packaging options if you're sending gifts directly to recipients.\"\"\""
