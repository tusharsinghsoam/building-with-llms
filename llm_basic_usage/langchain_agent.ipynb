      "Summary: Archimedes is purported to have invented a large scale solar furnace, sometimes described as a heat ray, and used it to burn attacking Roman ships during the Siege of Syracuse (c. 213–212 BC). It does not appear in the surviving works of Archimedes and there is no contemporary evidence for it, leading to modern scholars doubting its existence. It was an established story about Archimedes by around 500 AD, when Anthemius described a reconstruction, and it has become the subject of speculation about its plausibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Archimedes\n",
      "Summary: Archimedes of Syracuse ( AR-kih-MEE-deez; c. 287 – c. 212 BC) was an Ancient Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, and inventor from the city of Syracuse in Sicily. Although few details of his life are known, based on his surviving work, he is considered one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity, and one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying the concept of the infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove many geometrical theorems, including the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, the area of an ellipse, the area under a parabola, the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution, the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution, and the area of a spiral.\n",
      "Archimedes' other mathematical achievements include deriving an approximation of pi (π), defining and investigating the Archimedean spiral, and devising a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers. He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, working on statics and hydrostatics. Archimedes' achievements in this area include a proof of the law of the lever, the widespread use of the concept of center of gravity, and the enunciation of the law of buoyancy known as Archimedes' principle. In astronomy, he made measurements of the apparent diameter of the Sun and the size of the universe. He is also said to have built a planetarium device that demonstrated the movements of the known celestial bodies, and may have been a precursor to the Antikythera mechanism. He is also credited with designing innovative machines, such as his screw pump, compound pulleys, and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion.\n",
      "Archimedes died during the siege of Syracuse, when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. Cicero describes visiting Archimedes' tomb, which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder that Archimedes requested be placed there to represent his most valued mathematical discovery.\n",
      "Unlike his inventions, Archimedes' mathematical writings were little known in antiquity. Alexandrian mathematicians read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until c. 530 AD by Isidore of Miletus in Byzantine Constantinople, while Eutocius' commentaries on Archimedes' works in the same century opened them to wider readership for the first time. In the Middle Ages, Archimedes' work was translated into Arabic in the 9th century and then into Latin in the 12th century, and were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the Renaissance and in the Scientific Revolution. The discovery in 1906 of works by Archimedes in the Archimedes Palimpsest has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.\n",

      "Summary: Archimedes \"Archie\" Francisco Trajano (1956–1977) was a Filipino student activist during the 1972–1986 martial law regime in the Philippines. His death in 1977 has been linked to Imee Marcos, the daughter of the Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who was President at the time....\n",
      "Result: According to historical records, Archimedes was killed by a Roman soldier during the siege of Syracuse, despite orders that he should not be harmed. There is no definitive record of his last words. However, a popular anecdote suggests that he was working on a mathematical diagram when a Roman soldier commanded him to follow Marcellus. He refused, saying \"Noli turbare circulos meos!\" which translates to \"Do not disturb my circles!\" This quote is often cited as his last words, but it's important to note that this might be a legend rather than a historically accurate account.\n"
