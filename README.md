# Building with LLMs

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive learning journey focused on understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) and their practical applications. The content is structured to take you from fundamental concepts to modern, real-world applications of LLMs.

## Learning Path

The repository follows a progressive learning approach:

1. **Fundamentals** - Core concepts of LLMs, how they work, and their underlying architecture
2. **Intermediate Topics** - Prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and model optimization techniques
3. **Modern Applications** - Building production-ready applications, integrating LLMs into workflows, and exploring cutting-edge use cases

## Goals

- Develop a deep understanding of LLM technology
- Master practical skills for working with LLMs
- Build real-world applications leveraging LLM capabilities
- Stay current with the latest developments in the LLM ecosystem
